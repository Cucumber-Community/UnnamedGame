# UnnamedGame
A cool 3D game made by me and my friends, more info in readme


basically this is the idea so far:
- Time loop of sorts however certain things that are changed by the player throughout the run and their dead body when the run ends stays in future loops while everything else resets (and maybe shifts and gets reordered).
- This will be used to make puzzles that are time sensitive in a constantly changing setting (which is undecided but will be an enclosed space). There will also probably be some mechanic for loop reset like in outer wilds to allow for time gated puzzles to happen.
- There will be writing on the wall and graffiti and messages that will aid the player (kinda like portal) but the player will eventually find out all of these were written by past versions of himself
- The reason the game starts then is because the character (after a very long period doing loops) does something  to make it so that his memories wonâ€™t be forgotten at the start of every loop then on (idk what yet). He progressed before through the messages he wrote for his future self.
- It will also be pretty story driven and we can explore the philosophical aspect of this stuff(e.g: whether the same person who starts the loop is the same person from the previous loop, as their memories is the only thing retained and stuff like what defines sentience or what it means to be human)
- It will be a pretty short game maybe around the length of portal?
